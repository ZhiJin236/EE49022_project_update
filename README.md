# EE49022_project_update

Here is the complete version of code about using stm32f4 to control ili9341 lcd screen. 

This branch of code is work for a senior design project in Purdue EE deparatment.
The funtionality of this code is to display our targeting sound's location in a size representing a small classroom. 
To implement this code to the MCU stm32f407, it will output a compatiable graph and an accurate pin location for the targeting sound on ili9341.

Due to the small screen size of ili9341, this project will use a larger 7' display screen later on. However, the code then needs to be revised based on the change of the screen.
